PROJECTS
Senior Project
1/03
–
6/03
•
Built a transmitter and
receiver for an audio signal
•
Utilized direct sequence spread spectrum
system and modulated data signal using
BPSK (Binary Phase
Shift Keying)
•
Demodulated signal using 2 parallel integrator
s to
get more reliable data at the receiver
Narrowband Amplifier Project
1/03
–
3/03
•
With the aid
of Agilent’s ADS software, designed narrowband amplifier by meeting
specified requirements: frequency range of
1200-1500MHz, source and load impedance
of 50
Ohms, input and output
VSWR less than
2.0 and less than 1dB
ripple
Digilock Project
9/02
– 12/02
•
Designed an
FSM using VHDL
and StateCAD software
•
Physically implemented functions by
programming and testing a PAL using VHDL,
NOVA,
StateCAD, and hardware tests
Waveform Generator
Project
9/02
